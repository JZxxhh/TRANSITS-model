## TRANSITS-model
**TRANSITS** (TRansfer of Atmospheric Nitrate Stable Isotopes To the Snow), a novel conceptual, multi-layer and one-dimensional model representing the impact of processes operating on nitrate at the air–snow interface. The model is developed by Joseph Erbland to simulate the impact of post-depositional processing on snow nitrate preservation at Dome C, Antarctica and has been applied to many other ice-core drilling sites.
